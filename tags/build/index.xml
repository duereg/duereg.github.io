      <description>So we&amp;rsquo;ve rolled out a new build process at work. I&amp;rsquo;ve started working with a new company, and when I arrived, the build process for a new environment consisted of a 20 page manual somebody had written. The process of putting a build on an environment was slow, the manual had steps missing that everyone just &amp;lsquo;knew&amp;rsquo;, the process had multiple failure points, and was more or less a complete disaster.</description>

      <description>My client tasked me with upgrading their build server. Today, their platform builds VS 2080 solutions in .NET 3.5 - and I&amp;rsquo;ve been pushing to upgrade everyone to Visual Studio (VS) 2010 and eventually .NET 4.0. I want to upgrade the server to build a VS 2010 solution in .NET 3.5.
This will allow everyone to upgrade to VS 2010 while leaving the task of upgrading the production web servers to another day.</description>
