      <description>&lt;p&gt;I just finished the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_%5C%28abstract_data_type%5C%29&#34;&gt;Stack&lt;/a&gt; section of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/098478280X/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=098478280X&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=aplfopoex-20&#34;&gt;Cracking the Coding Interview&lt;/a&gt; and came across an old puzzle - &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi&#34;&gt;The Tower of Hanoi&lt;/a&gt;. I struggled with solving this problem. I wrote this elaborate, strange algorithm to try to solve it (which should have been a dead give-away that I had it wrong). Ironically enough, hidden in the 20-30 lines of code I wrote were the three lines of code I needed to solve the problem. Anyways, after beating my head in trying to solve this, I ended up going to the back of the book and looking up the solution. And found this pile of shit psuedocode. I&amp;rsquo;ve shortened the comments, but the content is the same.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
