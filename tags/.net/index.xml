      <description>At work we&amp;rsquo;ve been having some issues tracking down some nasty client side bugs. We know they&amp;rsquo;re happening in our Backbone views, but we&amp;rsquo;ve been unable to locate them with any accuracy due to the errors bubbling all the way to the window.onerror handler.
Enter Stackbone. A simple bit of code to instrument Backbone’s event loops to better locate client side errors.
To use:
Stackbone.start({ Backbone: Backbone jQuery: jQuery onError: function (err) { // .</description>

      <description>One of the projects I&amp;rsquo;m working on deals with source maps.
If you don&amp;rsquo;t know anything about source maps this link is a good introduction to what source maps are and why they&amp;rsquo;re useful.
Looking at the article date (March 21st, 2012), it&amp;rsquo;s not like source maps are some new hot thing. But the tooling around them is still pretty raw as is their use.
So why would you want to use source maps?</description>

      <title>My ongoing relation with CoffeeScript - and a gotcha</title>

      <description>CoffeeScript, what can I tell ya - I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to love it.
I have an unreasonable grudge against significant whitespace.
I couldn&amp;rsquo;t figure out the value of a language that compiles to another reasonable language.
And don&amp;rsquo;t even get me started on the for of/in thing. I still don&amp;rsquo;t understand that.
But the more I use CoffeeScript, the more I love it.
The lambdas are probably my biggest love - how can you not love them, in comparison to what JavaScript makes you do?</description>

      <description>EDIT: My fork is no longer needed. The folks at docco saw the same thing and recently ported over the library to use highlight.js.
 I love documentation generators for code. You know what I&amp;rsquo;ve talking about to - something which gives you a split screen of the code and the comments, side by side, for easy reading and scrolling. Like jasmine uses for their documentation:
Since I&amp;rsquo;ve mostly been working in JavaScript lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking for something to help document the packages I create easily.</description>

      <description>I spent a good bit of time working on the Esvalidate code that comes with Esprima, trying to get it to work smoothly with my sublime plugin. After submitting a massive pull request to the author of Esprima and our reviewing my code we came to a conclusion - the new code was better served in its own library.
It&amp;rsquo;s still in its early stages but please check out the progress I&amp;rsquo;m making here: Esvalidate Library</description>

      <description>A friend and I were working on some code together when we found an interesting edge case in .Net that neither of us knew about. This is what we knew: if you have a class with a protected field in it, if you declare a private class inside of that class, the private class can access the protected variable. The example below shows what this looks like.
public class ParentClassWithProtectedField { protected readonly int protectedField; private class PrivateClassInParentClass { public void Method(ParentClassWithProtectedField parent) { Console.</description>

      <description>I came across a brilliant project the other day - Esprima from Ariya Hidayat, the author of PhantomJS. What is Esprima? Esprima is a JavaScript Parser written in JavaScript Syntax Validator. It forms the basis of several different tools - a minifier, a code coverage tool, a syntax validator - just to name a few. I was immediately interested in the syntax validation tool. It&amp;rsquo;s not a linter - it just checks that the JavaScript written is syntactically correct.</description>

      <description>A preface to this post: it is hard to find a free SQL Parser for .NET. There is a company that has a terrible library that they charge $150 bucks for. There are a couple of incomplete implementations done for school projects or for narrowly focused tasks. So if you want a no-strings attached free parser for SQL, you&amp;rsquo;re out of luck. However, since most people who want a .NET parser are writing code on a Windows machine, and use Visual Studio, there is (lightly documented) hope: the TSqlParser library that ships with Visual Studio.</description>

      <description>I just finished the Stack section of Cracking the Coding Interview and came across an old puzzle - The Tower of Hanoi. I struggled with solving this problem. I wrote this elaborate, strange algorithm to try to solve it (which should have been a dead give-away that I had it wrong). Ironically enough, hidden in the 20-30 lines of code I wrote were the three lines of code I needed to solve the problem.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been going over the Linked List section of Cracking the Coding Interview and most times I get stumped with a problem the solution is the Runner Technique (or slow/fast pointers).
The idea behind the runner technique is simple; use two pointers that either move at different speeds or are a set distance apart and iterate through a list.
Why is this so useful? In some linked list problems you need to know the position of a certain element or the length of the list.</description>

The Command Palette feature, where you can search for a feature without having to know where it is in the application, is an piece of usability brilliance.

If you&amp;rsquo;re reading this post looking to add model persistence to your Derby application but don&amp;rsquo;t know much about MongoDB, understanding MongoDB will help you understand Derby and the model system it uses.
What&amp;rsquo;s MongoDB? From their website:
 MongoDB (from &amp;ldquo;humongous&amp;rdquo;) is a scalable, high-performance, open source NoSQL database.
 If you&amp;rsquo;ve never used MongoDB before, you should immediately go here.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning quite a bit about JavaScript in writing algorithms from Cracking the Coding Interview. I learned something new about strings in JavaScript and how they can be accessed. From MDN:
 Character access There are two ways to access an individual character in a string. The first is the charAt method:
 return &amp;#39;cat&amp;#39;.charAt(1); // returns &amp;#34;a&amp;#34; The other way is to treat the string as an array-like object, where individual characters correspond to a numerical index:</description>

      <description>I finished my third algorithm from Cracking the Coding Interview - the Trie.
Tries are a useful algorithm, if not all that well known. They can be used for efficient spell checking, auto suggestion, as well as the sorting of a collection of strings.
This algorithm was more complex to implement than the Linked List, but a little simpler than the Max/Min Binary Heap to implement.
The trie&amp;rsquo;s structure is easy to understand - it&amp;rsquo;s a word tree, where each leaf of the tree is a letter of a word.</description>

      <description>I finished my second algorithm from Cracking the Coding Interview - the Binary Heap. This algorithm racketed up the complexity from the Linked List.
The heap&amp;rsquo;s structure is easy to understand - it&amp;rsquo;s a binary tree (a tree where each node can have at most two children). In the case of a max heap, the parents have a greater value than their children. The values in a Max Heap decrease as you move down the tree from the parent to children.</description>

      <description>I finished my first algorithm from Cracking the Coding Interview - the almighty Singly Linked List.
This is the low-hanging fruit of the data structures I mean to tackle. Even implementing this simple structure, I managed to somehow squeeze in a bug that luckily I caught in my testing. An unfortunate case of premature optimization.
The code doesn&amp;rsquo;t look as cool as it did, but at least it does the job.</description>

      <description>Please note I came across a bug in the code, and revised this post on 31/07/2012.
 Came across an interesting problem today. In ASP.Net MVC, you can easily pass an enumerable of interfaces to your views from your controllers. As long as you have DisplayTemplates and EditorTemplates defined for the subclasses, then those classes will be rendered correctly from your enumerable of the parent interfaces.
However, if you then POST to a controller method that accepts an IEnumerable, you&amp;rsquo;ll get the error message:</description>

One of the hardest things about debugging software can be getting the users to document what went wrong so you can test the scenario. Problem Steps Recorder - which ships with Windows 7 - records a user&amp;rsquo;s actions and documents them in an easy to understand format. It even gives the user the option of sending the recording via e-mail right from the program.</description>

Today, their platform builds VS 2080 solutions in .NET 3.5 - and I&amp;rsquo;ve been pushing to upgrade everyone to Visual Studio (VS) 2010 and eventually .NET 4.0. I want to upgrade the server to build a VS 2010 solution in .NET 3.5.
This will allow everyone to upgrade to VS 2010 while leaving the task of upgrading the production web servers to another day.</description>

New problem today.
I was having problems getting Knockout to enable/disable my jQuery buttons using the Knockout &amp;lsquo;enable&amp;rsquo; bindingHandler. It would enable/disable the underlying element that I had run the .button() method on, but it had no idea about the div that jQuery had wrapped my element in, or how to handle it.</description>

      <description>I finished up the Nike+ data importer for www.runningahead.com. You can check out the code for the importer at this Github repository:
https://github.com/duereg/NikePlusImporter
I got a small test project up for this. It walks through everything but doesn&amp;rsquo;t Mock up the calls to the Nike+ service (I couldn&amp;rsquo;t be bothered). Let me know what you think.</description>

      <description>Is there anything better in life than finding a better way to do something? An easier commute, a better night&amp;rsquo;s sleep, a tastier cake recipe? In starting the Nike+ importer for www.runningahead.com, I knew I was going to have to deal with a bit of XML. Which used to mean XPath. Not so much anymore. LINQ to XML, you rock my world. It turns XML like this&amp;hellip;
&amp;lt;extendedDataList&amp;gt; &amp;lt;extendedData dataType=&amp;#34;distance&amp;#34; intervalType=&amp;#34;time&amp;#34; intervalUnit=&amp;#34;s&amp;#34; intervalValue=&amp;#34;10&amp;#34;&amp;gt; 0.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a fan of the website www.runningahead.com. I use it to track all my sporting life activities. The primary reason I use this site, instead of one of the hundreds like it, is that you can track anything - yoga, rowing, running, P-90x, underwater hockey, tiddlywinks, whatever. Throw in some customizable reporting and some great hardware integration, and it&amp;rsquo;s free, and you&amp;rsquo;ve got a winner.
That doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean there aren&amp;rsquo;t things I don&amp;rsquo;t like about the site, and things I wish could be better.</description>
