      <description>&lt;p&gt;My client tasked me with upgrading their build server. Today, their platform builds VS 2080 solutions in .NET 3.5 - and I&amp;rsquo;ve been pushing to upgrade everyone to Visual Studio (VS) 2010 and eventually .NET 4.0. I want to upgrade the server to build a VS 2010 solution in .NET 3.5.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This will allow everyone to upgrade to VS 2010 while leaving the task of upgrading the production web servers to another day. I tried the easy approach. I install .NET 4.0 on the build server and run the MSBuild scripts that already exist. Nothing good happens.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
