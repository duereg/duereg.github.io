      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve found a neat feature of &lt;a href=&#34;http://derbyjs.com&#34;&gt;derby&lt;/a&gt; dealing with the ready() function. I&amp;rsquo;ve been creating a derby app, and in my application I need to load up a client-side calendar. With a standard HTML web page this is straightforward thing to do. On the page you wanted the calendar, you would include the client js for the calendar, some code to load it, and that would be that. Derby introduced some complexity to this relatively simple task. On my first attempt, I put my scripts in the section of the page that I needed the calendar on. I added a script to load the calendar as well. When I went to the url of the page, it loaded immediately. Success! (I thought).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My client tasked me with upgrading their build server. Today, their platform builds VS 2080 solutions in .NET 3.5 - and I&amp;rsquo;ve been pushing to upgrade everyone to Visual Studio (VS) 2010 and eventually .NET 4.0. I want to upgrade the server to build a VS 2010 solution in .NET 3.5.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This will allow everyone to upgrade to VS 2010 while leaving the task of upgrading the production web servers to another day. I tried the easy approach. I install .NET 4.0 on the build server and run the MSBuild scripts that already exist. Nothing good happens.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
