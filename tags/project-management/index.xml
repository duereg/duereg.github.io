      <description>I was reviewing an old incident review doc where I wrote up some of the high level learnings from the incident. Thought it was worth sharing, with the details omitted to protect the innocent.
Some backstory; we were trying to load test a component and ended up getting the load testing done at the last minute right before customer launch. The team had to work into the weekend to meet the customer deadline.</description>

      <description>Some thoughts on how you could evaluate the state of the systems your team owns.
One way to use this:
 Put some of these criteria on the Y axis Put the name of the components you own on the X. Give everything a score from 1 to 0. Either average the scores or sum them to figure out which components need the most love.  If all of these are the same for everything you own, it might make sense to skip that section.</description>

      <description>Back when we were all the office together, it was pretty easy as a manager to get a feel for how the team was doing. Are folks getting along? Are folks stressed? Does everyone have the right balance of work? With folks all around you, it was pretty easy to drop in on a conversation, take someone to lunch, or grab a coffee and talk.
These small encounters gave you a chance to make sure your team was running efficiency, it also gave your team a chance to speak to you as a human being outside of formal settings.</description>

      <description>What is a Project Kickoff?  What is a project kick-off? A project kick-off meeting is the first meeting with the project team and the client of the project where applicable. This meeting is the time to establish common goals and the purpose of the project.
 Taken from the Atlassian Project Kickoff reference.
Why a Project Kickoff? A project kickoff sets a clear outline of project goals and milestones.</description>

      <description>Backlog Grooming Some thoughts on how you could evaluate the state of your backlog.
Small, well groomed backlog
 Are the tickets in the backlog going to be actioned in the near term? If you deleted the tickets that aren&amp;rsquo;t in your near-term roadmap, how long would it take you to recreate it? Is the Backlog consistently growing or shrinking? Are the tickets all in a state to be actioned immediately, or do they need additional work?</description>

      <description>More Shared Knowledge on Projects  Include more people in code reviews even if they&amp;rsquo;re not actively picking up development tasks &amp;ndash; this shares out knowledge of the changes and gets another set of eyes that can ask good questions Break team silos, share knowledge Do Team PR&amp;rsquo;s for big PR&amp;rsquo;s  Ideally break work into small pieces though   Do team share of projects for tech projects, share knowledge Team Collab!</description>
