      <description>Note: This is a compliment to the previous article I wrote about the Technical state of a Team, and explains the concepts in depth.
Technical State of the Team There’s a saying that people don’t leave companies, they leave managers. Management is a key part of any organization, yet the discipline is often self-taught and unstructured. Getting to the good solutions for complex management challenges can make the difference between fulfillment and frustration for teams, and, ultimately, between the success and failure of companies.</description>

Running your project Writing A Technical Design Document At this point, you’re ready to start designing your system.
A good technical design document should contain:
 An overview of the problem A breakdown of the individual milestones and how they’re related High-level process / workflow diagrams / designs / etc Any other notes that might be relevant to folks who will be working on the project  You should also consider if certain steps can be done in parallel, and what steps block other aspects of the work.</description>

      <description>Note: this is an expansion on a previous article I wrote around kickoff docs.
Project Kickoff! At this point, you should have a good idea of what your overall goal is. You should have a rough sketch of what your milestones are for the project and what you want to include in each one. You should not have the specific details of the projects worked out yet.
It’s time for a project kickoff.</description>

      <description>Note: This is a series of project planning talks I gave my team.
So you’ve got yourself a project A project (and a ticket) is a placeholder for a conversation. No matter if a ticket is super detailed or vague on what it wants, the best way to do good work is to figure out a few things about the work you’ve been given.
Get Comfortable Pre-planning for any project should begin FAR before the actual work.</description>

      <title>When to plan a project</title>

When to plan a project What is a project plan? Project planning is the process of defining your objectives and scope, your goals and milestones (deliverables), and assigning tasks and resources for each step. A good plan is easily shareable with everyone involved, and it’s most useful when it’s revisited regularly. Simply outlining a plan and never discussing it with your team again is a good recipe for wasted time and effort.</description>
