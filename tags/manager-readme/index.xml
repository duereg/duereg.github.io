      <description>A friend recently introduced me to the ideas of creating a Manager README.
The idea is that for coworkers and new team members, you give a rundown of how you like to work and what they can expect.
Some of the canonical READMEs that are frequently used as templates can be found here.
A list of the current READMEs out in the wild (including mine), as well as some links to guides to help write them, can be found here.</description>
