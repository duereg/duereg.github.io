      <description>This is an Express view engine which renders React components written in CoffeeScript on the server. It renders static markup and does not support mounting those views on the client.
This was derived from express-react-views
This is intended to be used as a replacement for existing server-side view solutions, like jade, ejs, or handlebars.
Usage npm install express-coffee-react-views react Note: You must explicitly install react as a dependency. react is a peer dependency here.</description>
