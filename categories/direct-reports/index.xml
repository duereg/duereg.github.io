      <description>Purpose The primary purpose of one-on-one meetings is to give your reports a chance to discuss issues and topics that they find important. It&amp;rsquo;s an opportunity for them to bring up concerns, challenges, and ideas that might not surface during regular team meetings. This is not a meeting to get status updates on projects! Schedule other time for that.
Frequency and Duration These meetings should be held regularly, ideally once a week, and should last anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour.</description>
