      <title>Mentorship Proposal</title>

      <description>Note: This is a proposal I put together with one of the engineers in my organization for a peer-directed mentorship program. I&amp;rsquo;ve removed names and fudged numbers but I hope it will serve as a valuable template. All other numbers quoted here are from outside studies, with links to the studies provided.
Peer Mentorship Proposal The most valuable asset of a company are its employees.
Among top reasons for millennials wanting to quit their jobs are &amp;lsquo;Not enough opportunities to advance&amp;rsquo; at 35% and &amp;lsquo;Lack of learning and development opportunities&amp;rsquo; at 28%.</description>

      <title>Technical State of the Team - Expanded</title>

      <description>Note: This is a compliment to the previous article I wrote about the Technical state of a Team, and explains the concepts in depth.
Technical State of the Team There’s a saying that people don’t leave companies, they leave managers. Management is a key part of any organization, yet the discipline is often self-taught and unstructured. Getting to the good solutions for complex management challenges can make the difference between fulfillment and frustration for teams, and, ultimately, between the success and failure of companies.</description>

      <description>All the previous project planning articles summarized into a checklist.

      <description>Note: This is a series of project planning talks I gave my team.
Running your project Writing A Technical Design Document At this point, you’re ready to start designing your system.
A good technical design document should contain:
 An overview of the problem A breakdown of the individual milestones and how they’re related High-level process / workflow diagrams / designs / etc Any other notes that might be relevant to folks who will be working on the project  You should also consider if certain steps can be done in parallel, and what steps block other aspects of the work.</description>

      <description>Note: this is an expansion on a previous article I wrote around kickoff docs.
Project Kickoff! At this point, you should have a good idea of what your overall goal is. You should have a rough sketch of what your milestones are for the project and what you want to include in each one. You should not have the specific details of the projects worked out yet.
It’s time for a project kickoff.</description>

      <description>Note: This is a series of project planning talks I gave my team.
So you’ve got yourself a project A project (and a ticket) is a placeholder for a conversation. No matter if a ticket is super detailed or vague on what it wants, the best way to do good work is to figure out a few things about the work you’ve been given.
Get Comfortable Pre-planning for any project should begin FAR before the actual work.</description>

      <title>When to plan a project</title>

      <description>Note: This is a series of project planning talks I gave my team.
When to plan a project What is a project plan? Project planning is the process of defining your objectives and scope, your goals and milestones (deliverables), and assigning tasks and resources for each step. A good plan is easily shareable with everyone involved, and it’s most useful when it’s revisited regularly. Simply outlining a plan and never discussing it with your team again is a good recipe for wasted time and effort.</description>

      <description>Setting Goals Two of the more popular methods for setting goals are SMART and CLEAR:
SMART Goals This method helps ensure that the goals have been thoroughly vetted. It also provides a way to clearly understand the implications of the goal-setting process.
Specific – To set specific goals, answer the following questions: who, what, where, when, which, and why.
Measurable – Create criteria that you can use to measure the success of a goal.</description>

      <description>Overview In re-reading High Output Management recently, I was particularly interested in reading over Andy Grove&amp;rsquo;s schedule and seeing how he spent his time. I thought it might be interesting to post something similar to how I allocate my time throughout the year.
Regular Occurring Events: Weekly 1:1’s with all direct reports Weekly 1:1’s with PM, Design, etc Weekly 1:1&amp;rsquo;s with my manager Weekly leadership meeting with pillar leadership Bi-weekly 1:1’s with peers Monthly Career Conversations with direct reports</description>

      <description>I was reviewing an old incident review doc where I wrote up some of the high level learnings from the incident. Thought it was worth sharing, with the details omitted to protect the innocent.
Some backstory; we were trying to load test a component and ended up getting the load testing done at the last minute right before customer launch. The team had to work into the weekend to meet the customer deadline.</description>

      <description>Some thoughts on how you could evaluate the state of the systems your team owns.
One way to use this:
 Put some of these criteria on the Y axis Put the name of the components you own on the X. Give everything a score from 1 to 0. Either average the scores or sum them to figure out which components need the most love.  If all of these are the same for everything you own, it might make sense to skip that section.</description>

      <title>The importance of clear communication</title>

      <guid>https://blog.mattblair.co/blog/20200909-pyramid-principle-inaction/</guid>
      <description>This is based off a talk I gave on improving communications.
There is a lot of communication right now With everyone working remotely, the importance of communication has increased. We&amp;rsquo;re communicating more often without meeting, and making your message clear when everyone is deluged with correspondance is the only way to have impact in your organization.
To succeed in any organization, you need to be able to tell your story. Whether it’s a status update, an RFC, or an escal question, you need to be able to quickly tell people the state of the world.</description>

      <description>Back when we were all the office together, it was pretty easy as a manager to get a feel for how the team was doing. Are folks getting along? Are folks stressed? Does everyone have the right balance of work? With folks all around you, it was pretty easy to drop in on a conversation, take someone to lunch, or grab a coffee and talk.
These small encounters gave you a chance to make sure your team was running efficiency, it also gave your team a chance to speak to you as a human being outside of formal settings.</description>

      <description>What is a Project Kickoff?  What is a project kick-off? A project kick-off meeting is the first meeting with the project team and the client of the project where applicable. This meeting is the time to establish common goals and the purpose of the project.
 Taken from the Atlassian Project Kickoff reference.
Why a Project Kickoff? A project kickoff sets a clear outline of project goals and milestones.</description>

      <description>Backlog Grooming Some thoughts on how you could evaluate the state of your backlog.
Small, well groomed backlog
 Are the tickets in the backlog going to be actioned in the near term? If you deleted the tickets that aren&amp;rsquo;t in your near-term roadmap, how long would it take you to recreate it? Is the Backlog consistently growing or shrinking? Are the tickets all in a state to be actioned immediately, or do they need additional work?</description>

      <description>I use SCQA all the time in my communications both up to leadership and down to my teams.
This TED talk from Derek Sivers is a great example of someone using SCQA to communicating a problem and a suggested solution in a short amount of time. Worth watching if you&amp;rsquo;re looking to use SCQA in your own communications.
Another example of an SCQA structured communication is something I received at work:</description>

      <description>Some further classes I recommend for potential new engineering managers.
https://www.harrisonmetal.com/library/objectives-key-results
So many companies want to set up goals in the OKR (Objective-Key Result) format. This shows some great examples how to format yours.
https://www.harrisonmetal.com/library/storytelling-amp-presenting-1-thank-you-barbara-minto
I use SCQA all the time in my communications both up to leadership and down to my teams. Highly recommend taking this class or reading The Pyramid Principle.
https://www.harrisonmetal.com/classes/gm2-setting-goals-measuring-performance
If you&amp;rsquo;re a manager, you&amp;rsquo;re going to have to figure out a way to set goals for your teams and measure the performance of those goals.</description>
