      <description>Onboarding Engineers with Mentorship Pods When you’re a small team, pairing each new hire 1:1 works great—but as you grow, that model becomes overwhelming. Mentorship pods solve this by pairing a single mentor with a small cohort of new engineers. They learn together, share questions, and ramp up faster than going it alone.
Why Pods? Pods create a community feel. Mentees learn from each other’s questions, and mentors can standardize core topics while still giving personalized attention.</description>
